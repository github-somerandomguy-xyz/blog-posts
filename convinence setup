convinence setup (optional): edit bashrc in the home dir, 

add these 2 lines under the history settings of the bashrc
bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'



finally should like (for sanity purpose, to group the history related business in 1 block of the script)
....
# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)
HISTSIZE=1000
HISTFILESIZE=2000

bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'
....

now you can type the first few letters of the command on bash and hit up|down arrow to search the commands that match the pre-text you entered, very handy low intrution hack, comes in handy when u spend a lot of time on the bash.

make the user sudo user 
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username>
when env == staging/ test env && !== (NOT Equal to) prod env:
add the sudo user to use sudo cmds with nopwd,
sudo visudo
add below line to the bottom of the file.
<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

finally refresh bash by logout (enter "exit" cmd) and then login again.
