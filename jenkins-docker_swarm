<Title>Using Jenkins to automate deployment on docker swarm
<subtitle>Use Jenkins to build and push the Docker image to a private docker registry and deploy Docker stack on a remote docker manager node with Ansible.
Jenkins is an ancient and one hell of a versatile tool to automate the crap out of everything. 
How to Install Jenkins:<basic install from war file, just download war file and run.>
on a debian/ubuntu distros you can do this:
Since Jenkins is an old-timer it's in Java, and you should make sure that you have jre installed.
if you have time try to get into the politics of the sun systems, java, and oracle triology of law suites.
if you are a normal person, i guess all you ned to do is to <how dafuk did i really install Java?>
<liftedd from there official site:(https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#debianubuntu)>
``````````````
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

``````````````

and visit you server IP's port 8080, 
common trouble shooting:
 throw in command:
  systemctl restart jenkins.service, 
  make sure the port number 8080 is allowed in your firewall, `ufw allow 8080` or somthing like that, depending on your firewall.

How to set up SSL on Jenkins(optional)<1st off you need to figure out this thing>
this is one of those things "you should do it once and do it good", 
i choose the path more take (like the opposite of what my Grandma would say).
I choose to use nginx as the reverse proxy and i did a very basic config to set this up on a sub-domain.
if you want the warning msg "your reverse proxy is broken" to be gone do this <you figure out this part first,>
all about creating user accounts (optional): <link to be put when the post for setting up LDAP, is finally set, or should i even bother with this??, maybe when excess oof time>.

existing setup:  <write about the structure, of where is Jenkins and where is the docker swarm, mention that they are on diff servers with diff IPs.>
so here's the scenario, you have the jenkins server installed on a VM somewhere, fortunately you have an ipv4 address to point to that server from anywhere.
and you have a docker swarm cluster running somewhere else (jenkins not part off the docker swarm cluster, that's what pussies do, installing jenkins in a docker container as part of the docker swarm, and jenkins would start gettinging painfully slow after a couple of test builds.... trust me i should know, lol).

{<perhaps , a post on docker regestry set up on docker swarm>, but is connected to traefik topic, perhaps docker swarm infra setup is it's post, it could include, traefik, internal network, docker regestry}.

existing setup:
assume docker registry is availabe on a domain address somewhere.
assume docker swarm is running



all about choosing Jenkins project, pipeline/freestyle/multibranch pipeline etc,.<probably a random rant topic>
Pipeline code explain:
