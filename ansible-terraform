How to install terraform and terraform-libvirt-provider on remote bare metal debian server.


Soo... kids, in todays class we will create th next big automation buzz word out there terraform.
here we will create 3 (I say 2.5) roles to do the following:
install terraform on a remote server
clone and build the terraform-libvirt-provider binary (using "go") and init a terrafom at the home directory.
copy our terraform source code to the remote server and execute a "terrafomr_apply" to create a test VM (VM image built using cloud-init).

here we do the folowing in the following order:
first we ensure that all the prerequisites are available, all u need is to unziip a file!
so you ""ensure" to make sure it's there.
next you just download it and put it in it's place.

- name: Ensure required packages are available.
  package:
    name: 
      - unzip
    state: present

- name: "Download terraform {{ terraform_version }} binary."
  get_url:
    url: "{{ terraform_download_url }}"
    dest: /tmp/

- name: unarchive and move terraform binary to executable location
  unarchive:
    src: "/tmp/terraform_{{ terraform_version }}_linux_amd64.zip"
    dest: /usr/local/bin/
    remote_src: yes
    
- name: change terraform file permissions
  file:
    path: /usr/local/bin/terraform
    mode: u+x
    owner: "{{ansible_user}}"
    group: "{{ansible_user}}"
    
- name: cleanup residue
  file:
    path: "/tmp/terraform_{{ terraform_version }}_linux_amd64.zip"
    state: absent



the best way to not get trapped in golang's fun trip with setting PATH varibles rolletcoster ride is to never thouch that mess.
to never be able to touch it, i made sure I used the right user to run the go command. 
let me explain: here the goal is to create the binary for the lib-virt provider.
in there documentation they say it would be created in the bin folder.
go was compaining it yould not find the go path something like that.
especially if u do not want to use the full path.
main lession learnt is to call using the full path of the go route.
if u want to access it as  non-root user it's a whole new gimmic, to set the .profile etc,.
for this another user, to avoid all that, i made sure the default setting is not to be a root user for the entire role, instead it's important/ or very usefull to  be the right kinda of user at the very early stagee.
in my case the go folder created by this task

This would ideally be the place where everything comes together finally.
the big climax, ( that never happened #spolerAlert #toolate)
even thought this would work perfectly well if your baremetal server is a virgin server,
but unfortunately that's seldom the case in the real world, no self respcting admins with a pulse, would let that be the case(... I think).
but in my case the issue was there was already an preexisting infra on the server (mainly networkconfigs and virsh VMs managed by KVM hypervisers), now the terraformform docs do give a nifty soultions for this, using "imports" or something <do proper reasearch on why we cannot codify all the imports on existing infra> am not really sure how it works, based on the 2nd hand info from stackoverflow and googing around, i see that i should execute the "import"on terraform cli, i find this sooultion ugly, i woulld rather mentione it in the code, to import all the exising infra, 
one idea is to use the ansible facts as the input for the terraform imports and make terraform initialize and maintain a terraform state from there.<should do reasearch on, weather it's possiable, if nt why it's not possablle">
